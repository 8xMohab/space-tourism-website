## My process

I started working on this project by looking at the design in Figma and forming a general idea of how I was going to build the layout, web structure, and components. then I built the html structure and the JS functionalities, then added the styles with tailwind css.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS build tool
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- Optimisation and grouping of repetitive properties into custom classes.
- Improving the layout on the very large screens (2k - 4k).
